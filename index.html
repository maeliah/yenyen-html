	<h1>My New Year Celebration üòΩ</h1>
	<p> This New Year motivated me to become a better person of myself. It was filled with laughter, people jumping, eating 12 grapes under a table, people lighting fireworks, and many more! This New Year made me feel as if I am becoming a new person and a better friend. 2024 did me well, but this 2025, it will do me best. This year, I've been inspired alot especially since I have my friends and my family to support me in every decisions I make, whether its bad or good, they choose to help me find the right path.</p>
	
	<p><b> 2025, please do me best. ‚ú®</b></p>
